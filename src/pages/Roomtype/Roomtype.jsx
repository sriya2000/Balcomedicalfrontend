            <p>
              The general ward is a spacious, air-conditioned, multi-bed ward
              consisting of 44 beds. Steps are taken to maintain patient privacy
              while allowing patients to benefit from more affordable tariffs
              and still making available all other essential amenities such as
              common waiting area separate for male and female attendants,
              television, and individual side lockers and bedside visitorâ€™s
              chairs, etc. Vedanta group companies have supported over 4,00,000
              women and children through education, nutrition and empowerment
              programmes. Additionally, hospitals, mobile health centres, and
              rural health posts supported by the group have provided healthcare
              for another 2.2 million people. Mr. Agarwal now intends to expand
              this medical support through the Vedanta Cancer Hospital and
              Research Centre.
